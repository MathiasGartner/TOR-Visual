# TOR-Visual
This repository hosts the visualization program for the project [**The Transparency of Randomness (TOR)**](https://github.com/MathiasGartner/TOR).

## Description

The dynamic visualizations use the live data that is generated by the interactive TOR installation. Data is retrieved from the projects SQL database.

There are two main visualization panels:
- generative graphics based on random walks for each box/material featured in the TOR installation
- visualization of the approximation of the number Ï€ based on a Monte Carlo method using the random numbers that are generated by the whole TOR installation

## Resources

We use the Java library [Processing](https://processing.org/) and the provided base class `processing.core.PApplet` for all graphics related functionality.
